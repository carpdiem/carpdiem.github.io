> There's a lot said about culture, and most of it is BS. The only thing that matters in a startup's culture is whether or not all members of the company share a deep trust with each other. The operative question is "Would they take a bullet for me?". When asked from anyone's perspective, and directed at anyone else, the answer had better be "yes". As a leader, judge every action, policy, incentive, and plan with regards to whether it deepens or depletes trust.

> Delegation is a two-way contract. It must have a clear vision and strategy defined from above, and tactical authority and true acceptance from below. The delegator specifies the goal and the delegatee specifies what they need to accomplish it. Vitally, the delegatee must truly be able to say no if they deem the task impossible given the resource constraints.<!--more-->

*Startups are hard. These are my guidelines for making them a little bit easier.*
{: style="text-align: center;" }

*These thoughts are, of course, applicable to many other situations in life as well, but by using the word "startup", I hope to attract the attention of people in startups, for whom this advice may make a tangible difference between success and failure.*
{: style="text-align: center;" }

*This is the most directly actionable advice I have distilled from more than a decade in the field, and I wish someone had presented it to me, in just this way, when I was new.*

## Communication

The typical communication involves three distinct translation steps.

First, an *idea* in one person's mind must be translated into *words that are spoken*.

Second, the *spoken words* are translated into *heard words*.

And third, the *heard words* are translated into an *idea* in the second person's mind. Each of these translation steps is an opportunity for errors to creep in, and miscommunication to result.

*this happens to everyone*

This is the origin of a peculiar paradox: everyone has heard plenty of other people say dumb things, yet when asked, everyone will tell you that they try very hard not to say dumb things themselves!

The solution is that most of the time when something sounds dumb, it's because the idea that you've ended up with in your mind (after three steps of potential translation error) doesn't match the idea that was in the speaker's mind. Thus, they may have been trying to express an idea that made perfect sense to them, but by the time it's reached you it just seems sort of stupidâ€¦ *because it's not the same idea*.

Most of the time you can resolve these sorts of issues by borrowing a page from the scientific method.

**Step 1:** Clean your data. Make sure you've heard them correctly by just repeating their words back to them and asking if that's what they've said.

**Step 2:** Come up with a prediction about an implication of the idea that's outside the direct bounds of what they've just said, and see if they agree with your prediction.

Step 2 is usually the tricking one. The idea here is that since there's no way to directly compare the neural pulses in your brain with theirs, the best you can do is try to make sure that all of the predictions that arise from the idea in your mind match all of the predictions of the idea in their mind. If this is broadly true, then for all practical intents and purposes, the two ideas are the same.

### Here are some examples of what this might look like:

*Person A:* "Unemployment is bad."

*Person B:* "Do you mean that no one should be allowed to quit their job and take time off?"

*Person A:* "No! Just that if too many people want jobs and can't find them, it's not good."

-- or --

*Person A:* "Facts aren't always true."

*Person B:* "What? Like linear differential equations don't have unique solutions?"

*Person A:* "Naw, just that when someone shows up with some data, you have to question it! How was it collected? Is there a bias towards one viewpoint above others? Which industry group paid for it?"

-- or even --

*Person A:* "This surface needs to be smooth."

*Person B:* "So you mean you want it to be polished so it doesn't feel rough?"

*Person A:* "More than that! We have to make sure that reflections on any part don't have sudden changes!"

## Management

Management is about developing and ensuring comparative advantages, so that tasks can get done as efficiently and effectively as possible.

*If you'd like a refresher on comparative advantages and why they're important, check out the beginning of my essay on [Comparative Advantage and the Theory of Intertemporal Self-Trade]({{ site.url }}{% link _essays/Comparative-Advantage-and-the-Theory-of-Intertemporal-Self-Trade.markdown %}).*

**For managing yourself**, you can create comparative advantages between different days by trying to arrange your schedule to minimize context-switching costs. This is related to Paul Graham's idea of the [Maker Schedule vs Manager Schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), but slightly more expansive.

Of course, a la PG, it's better to schedule meetings together in a concentrated batch, and ideally to keep them fully separate from blocks of time dedicated to deep work. But we can go further than this and say that even among blocks of deep work, it's usually more efficient to focus on just one thing at a time, for as long as possible; so if you've got a to-do list that consists of a database migration, refining a new SVM model, and setting up A/B tests for marketing copy, for the love of god, do them one at a time if at all possible.

**Managing teams** is a little different.
