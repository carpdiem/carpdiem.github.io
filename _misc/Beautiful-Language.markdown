### "godshatter"

From [this post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/18/the-whole-city-is-center/) on Slate Star Codex:

> *"Huge chunks of our hopes and dreams are the [godshatter](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSXZpvqpa9vbGGLtG/thou-art-godshatter) of misfired-evolutionary processes."*

#### As roughly as I can manage:

godshatter; noun - Components or attributes of something which originally derived from some higher power, process, or purpose, and have now taken on independent meaning, existence, or purposeâ€”usually more specific and less general than that of the originating higher power, process, or purpose.

> *Flowers are the godshatter of nature's abhorrence for high energy gradients.*

### "aces"

From [@craig_montuori](https://twitter.com/craig_montuori), from one of the historical biographies he once told me about.

> *"He was looking aces."*

aces; adjective - Superlative signifying excellence, best quality, without peer.
