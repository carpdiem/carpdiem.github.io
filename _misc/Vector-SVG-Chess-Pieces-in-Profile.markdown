For a long time, I've wanted to make a really classy, slim profile, magnetic chess set with the laser cutters, and here's the first step: a high-quality set of pieces in .svg format (though the image above is a .png for display purposes). It took me most of the day, but I think the end result is worth it. These are based on the classic [Staunton design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton_chess_set).
