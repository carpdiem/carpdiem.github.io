We're starting to see a new stage in the evolution of storytelling.

Storytelling has always adapted itself to the means of its audience. In particular, the kinds of stories told are molded by both the technological and cultural context of the readers. In pre-Gutenberg times, when essentially all storytelling was oral, stories were simpler, with few characters to forget, and few plot points to remember. Books, and the simultaneous ability to discuss and analyze them in writing, brought detail. The great struggles of ideology in the 1900s brought a focus on good-vs-evil. Visual media, from comic books to cartoons, practically invented fantastical costumes. And now, with social media as our backdrop of choice, we're starting to see the emergence of memephilic narratives.<!--more-->

What do I mean by this? Simply that the stories being told, being talked about, and becoming popular are increasingly shifting towards those that better support associated social media memes and content.

Let's talk about some examples.

The Harry Potter series is a turning point for this phenomenon. Sure, it's got a traditional story of good-vs-evil at its core, alongside a dash of coming-of-age, but notice that it's told within a backdrop of the Hogwarts house system. Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. I didn't have to look those up, and that's the point. Because while Harry Potter took the world by storm, what are the most shared pieces of content from it but the houses? Four factions to choose from and identify yourself with. Enough room for everyone, and certainly enough fodder for endless personality quizzes, bumper stickers, embroidered sweaters, cosplay efforts, coffee cups, and more.

The next major work in this vein is A Song of Ice and Fire, aka - Game of Thrones. And indeed, George R R Martin is famous for upheaving our initial beliefs of moral standing of his charactersâ€”there's little good-vs-evil here! What do we have instead? Factions again, each with their own identity and attributes, and even each with a detailed icon (read: "crest") and even a pithy quote (house words), ready to be plastered on sweaters and screenshots alike.

More recently, we have the Stormlight Archive series from Brandon Sanderson, and what does it contain but a list of ten "orders", each with a name, symbol, uniquely identifying attributes, [an official personality quiz](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/announcing-the-official-knights-radiant-order-quiz-stormlight-phone-wallpaper/), and even [themed Kickstarter merch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonsteel/the-way-of-kings-10th-anniversary-leatherbound-edition).

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining about this shift in storytelling, just observing it.

Observing it, and predicting the further demise of the last gneration, good-vs-evil tropes, and the continued ascendance of multi-faction, find-your-reflection-somewhere-and-share-it-on-facebook stories.
