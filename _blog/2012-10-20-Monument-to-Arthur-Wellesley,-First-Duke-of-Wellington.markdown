Here, at the Duke of Wellington's monument.

An obelisk, standing alone in a field, stretching to the sky.

The base is a pavilion of slanted stair steps, making the walk up to the inscriptions a hike rather than a stroll.

Sweat a bit in the Duke's honor, for his journey was tougher than yours, and you are in his debt!
