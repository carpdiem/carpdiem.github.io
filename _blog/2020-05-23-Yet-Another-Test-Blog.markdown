EDIT: Look, an edit!

This is a test blog entry!

There have been many test blog entries like it, but this one is mine.

I hope you like it!

There once was a little lamb named Mary, who's fleas were white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, the plague was sure to go.

It has come to my attention that this blog post is just too short to test out the features that I desire to test! As such, I will have to add extra text here until, roughly, the cows come home. Since I have neither cows, nor a home (I rent), this might take a while. I'm guessing years. Maybe decades. Centuries? When will I grow weary of suburban living and long for a retirement to the agrarian countryside? A simpler life, to be sure. Turnips and cows and empty spaces to the horizon. A slower life. And a less impactful one. Sounds awful. But maybe I'd enjoy visiting.
