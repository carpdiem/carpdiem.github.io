I've been meaning to run through the [Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course on practical deep learning for about a year now, since I first learned of it, and it's finally time. As usual, I'll be burning down through this quickly, and thankfully have a pretty deep background in the gnarlier, more mathematical aspects of the field... (I've derived and implemented backprop by hand a number of times, and most recently on the professional side, was SVP product for a startup building LLM Inference HW, so I've become quite familiar with the underlying theory and architectures).

But now it's time to roll my sleeves up and learn the hands-on tools.<!--more-->

I'll be using this space to track and update any particularly interesting things I learn along the way.
