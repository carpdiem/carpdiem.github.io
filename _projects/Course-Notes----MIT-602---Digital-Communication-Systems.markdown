Here's another set of my course notes, this time for [MIT's 6.02 - Digital Communication Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-02-introduction-to-eecs-ii-digital-communication-systems-fall-2012/) course on [OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

If you haven't seen OCW yet, you should check it out, they've got unadulterated courses straight from MIT with not only lecture videos, but also with all of the problem sets and exams.

In these course notes, I dedicate each column to notes on roughly 1 week of lectures, and end the columns with my solutions for the corresponding problem set. In this way, the following .pdf has an entire semester's worth of notes & work in it; with the exception, that is, of the programming labs. While I enjoyed going through those, it was long enough ago that I don't particularly feel compelled to go through the trouble of putting them up online, but let me know if you have any questions about them. In particular, the audiocom files for labs 4-6 that are included as part of the OCW download are not complete, and I had to source the correct originals from [John Wang's github repo of MIT class materials](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-02-introduction-to-eecs-ii-digital-communication-systems-fall-2012/).<!--more-->
