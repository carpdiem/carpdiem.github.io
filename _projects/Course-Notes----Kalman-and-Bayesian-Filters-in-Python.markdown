I do a lot of independent study of technical courses, and my favorite tool for note-taking is the [Concepts App](https://concepts.app/en/) paired with an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. The combination of an infinite canvas as well as a collection of graphic-design-inspired tools for annotating/sketching/editing is unparalleled, and lets you get an entire set of course notes, problem set solutions, and more, into a single document that's easy to explore.

When I've shown my notes to others in the past, they've often told me I should find a way to share them.

Well, now I've found a way.

These are my course notes from self-studying of [Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python), the same course I recommend in my project piece [How do you learn (Extended) Kalman Filters?]({{ site.url }}/projects/How-do-you-learn-(Extended)-Kalman-Filters.html).
