- 226g unsalted butter
- 90g powdered sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 280g AP flour
- 25g cornstarch
- 1/2 tsp salt

For best results, measure ingredients with a scale by weight.

Put the twarog in the mixer, add sugar, and vanilla extract, and mix.
Then add eggs, and mix.

Take a 12"x8"x2" baking form, coated with butter, and pour the mix in (no higher than 1/2 to 2/3 of the height of the pan).

After 90 min, turn the oven OFF.
Do not open the oven until it cools down!
