This is a test blog post. I just made some beef. Beef Beef Beef. I'm waiting to eat it. When will I get past 70 words? I really want to be past 70 words. This is a word, and another one, and again and again and again. This probably isn't 70 words yet, but it must be getting close.

How about now? In a second paragraph? Will I hit 70 words in this paragraph? Maybe? Maybe not! Who knows? I could do a word count, but I don't actually know how to do that in vim. Maybe I should find out. There's probably a command for it, or if not, definitely a plugin.
