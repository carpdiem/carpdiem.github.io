There's a thing you run into when prepping for product management interviews called "Product Sense". Nominally, it's the name of a specific interview type run by just about every product organization in tech. These interviews all focus around thinking about new potential products, but they're explicitly not about *how to design* new products.

Instead, they're about *what* to design and build, and *why*.

But that's getting ahead of ourselves. First, let's break down the structure of a company, and understand how product fits in:

Our lens for this step will be the tactical / strategic divide: *strategic* referring to higher levels of abstraction, to "the big picture", and is most closely tied to a company's mission. *Tactical*, however, ties to lower levels of abstraction, to things closer to implementation.

Good product management is tactical with respect to the CEO's strategic vision: the CEO charts the course for the company's *raison d'etre*, and the PMs have to figure out what that means in terms of specific products to propose & build.

Good product management is also strategic with respect to Engineering's implementation efforts: product selection, direction, and roadmaps concern themselves with *what is to be built* rather than *precisely how to build it*.

Good product management thusly balances the needs of the business and of the customer alongside the opportunities of the technology.

Let's take a moment to talk about some lenses on products:

## The Seven Deadly Sins

Much of consumer advertising, sales, and product adoption occurs on the basis of the [seven deadly sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins), and you can see this everywhere you look.

- Lust: Sex sells. It always has, and it always will, but it's not always as explicit as movie posters and dating websites. Famously, facebook's original "killer feature" was the 'relationship status' field. And these days everything from cars to personal instagram brands rely heavily on a sense of 'sexiness' for their appeal.

- Gluttony: Obviously food, but more generally, the entire trend of "selling experiences" falls into this category. Movies are described as "a feast for the eyes", and getaway advertisements exhort you to "treat yourself".

- Greed: Financial services. Lotteries. Courses on success of all kinds. In a non-monetary sense, especially anything tied to social status: diet regimens, luxury possessions and memberships.

- Sloth: Anything that saves time or promises results with less effort. "One weird trick"s. Tools and gadgets of all sorts.

- Wrath: I expand this to cover competition and struggle against adversaries. This yields almost anything sport related, the entire defense (and personal defense) industry, and a huge swath of games and videogames.

- Envy: is often a secondary factor to many of the above, but comes to the forefront especially with Instagram. 

- Pride: Another common secondary factor. Especially gluttony and greed can be paired with pride for things tied to a sense of your self: "crafted with the finest materials" translates to "you can take pride in owning this"; "exclusively for the discerning client"; "one of a kind".


## The top of Maslow's Hierarchy

Separate from how you *sell* a product is the *pain point* it addresses. Now, every level of Maslow's Hierarchy contain possible pain points, but I'll focus on a more unique subsection: a breakdown of the self-actualization top into the fields of human endeavor: communication, coordination, invention, transaction, expression, education, exploration, competition, connection, optimization.

I want to say something here about 'tech industry pain points' and distinguish these from all the other, lower-levels-of-Maslow pain points around physiological needs, but bleh, I'll find good words for that later.

Also, there should be at least a short list of examples.

## The stuff you need to cover in a product sense interview

Your goal is to demonstrate that you can bridge the gap between the strategic priorities of the company and the pain points of the customers in order to generate value. And importantly, you have to show that you have a systematic way of doing so, to generate confidence that you can do this in any circumstance or scenario.

THIS MEANS YOU CAN'T JUST START WITH A POINT-IDEA OF THE CUSTOMER/PAIN/SOLUTION.

Instead, start with understanding the strategic goals of the company. If you miss those, you're fucked.

Then, from a strategic goal (like 'generate more revenue' or 'grow in a new market', or whatever), look for the easiest potential market segments with the greatest payoffs towards the strategic goals. (aka - if revenues, which customers have willingness to pay / etc)

Now look for pain points of those customers that jive well with the company's strategic mission.

And wrap up with specific ideas, prioritized by technical feasibility.

What's the "Minimum Viable Framework"?

-> Strategic (Company) Motivation & Landscape (incl. should _we_ actually be building this?)

-> Users & Their Pain Points

-> Solutions


Design a killer new feature for Apple:

- apple is a brand that focuses on premium experiences, bringing powerful tools to creators of all sorts. They sell based on pride, envy, and sloth, and in recent years have turned a closer eye towards advertising their technical prowess. They want to define the future of computing, but have found themselves lagging behind modern AI development.

- their competitors: google, meta, microsoft. lesser: huawei, lenovo, etc.

- goal: reinvigorate "wow" factor for apple products.

- users: creators vs consumers
    -> creators: professional vs amateur/student
    -> consumers: adult vs child?

    focus on professional creators! Busy people, have $$ to spend on great solutions, and they set the tone for everyone to aspire to.

- burgeoning AR/VR space. huge pain point around asset creation for AR/VR experiences. requires really painful tools, and relies on a large cluster of skills.

- soln: lean into voice interface for genAI powered asset creation for AR/VR. 


Design a great medical product (for a new startup):

- users: children vs adults vs elderly
    focus on elderly for growing population, high severity/importance of medical issues

- pain point: just remembering precisely what happened to be able to describe to dr later

- soln: "assisted dictation": free-form voice input app (includes ability to take & attach photos / video) to record your experiences / symptoms / etc as they're happening, and convert them into a medically-accessible format. Can include (AI?) assisted 'prompt' questions (e.g., "you said you felt pain, can you rank that on a scale of 1-10 for me?")


metrics:
- user adoption
- customer satisfaction
- business impact

Wild thought: give GPT the ability to interrupt you! Maybe have an 'interrupt' vs 'keep listening' token?

part 1 - why should we build this?
- any trends in this space?
- company (strategy/mission) / opportunities?
- company strengths & weaknesses

part 2 - user segmentation
- map the ecosystem
  -> who are ecosystem players & incentives?
- segment
  -> most & least frequent users on the spectrum?
  -> segmenting on behavior is better than on demographic
  -> MECE
  -> avoid niche
  -> who has different pain points?
- how to prioritize
  -> TAM
  -> frequency of use
  -> underserved population
  -> spend

part 3 - pain points
- create a user journey
  -> understand the current user journey without your product. what are the pain points?
- identify pain points
  -> which parts of the current user journey are frustrating / painful / sub-optimal?
  -> 
- prioritize pain points
  -> can prioritize on: how many people are affected? how painful is it? how many alternate solutions already exist?


part 4 - creative solutions
- identify specific pain points / AVOID GENERIC PAIN POINTS
- consider trends and technologies
- borrow from other verticals with similar problems
- 


Other things to consider:
- highlight trade-offs and rationale for choice in those trade-offs
- build on long-lasting advantages
- ensure specific differentiation
- what are both the leading and lagging indicators of success?
-
